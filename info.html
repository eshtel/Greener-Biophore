            <p>At the Greener Biophore event, we will hear talks and participate in workshops to brainstorm on how to improve sustainability in our building! 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Greener Biophore is an event for the members of the Biophore community to discuss and find solutions 
            to improve our carbon footprint as scientists. We will discuss solutions for our building, but the event is open to everyone interested in the topic!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Our primary goal is to empower researchers by facilitating the identification and exploration of realistic sustainability actions that can be implemented at the individual, group, and departmental levels. Additionally, we aim to address any obstacles or limitations participants may encounter by acting as intermediaries to bring these concerns to the attention of relevant stakeholders (e.g., university services, Direction, department heads, etc) and work towards viable solutions.</p>

            <p>If your schedule only allows you to attend in the morning talks or the afternoon workshop, you are still welcome to join. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You can register for just either of these sessions, though we encourage you to take part in both as the talks will be highly informative for the workshop. </p>
